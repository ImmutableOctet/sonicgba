# Sonic GBA

Sonic GBA is a fan developed reinterpretation of decompiled Java output from the Android version of Sonic Advance.

All software is developed using the [Monkey programming language](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey).

This project aims to maintain a codebase that resembles the original decompiled output,
without making any claim to parody the original behavior in any way.
