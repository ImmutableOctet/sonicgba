# Description
This file contains all of the known/documented object IDs (Types).

Object IDs are represented with the 'objId' field, presumably located in 'GameObject' or 'GimmickObject'.

This list is not finished, and may or may not actually reflect the code. Take this information with a grain of salt.
This list contains ID/type numbers, what we think they are, and optionally, where we learned about them.

### The module sitation syntax is as follows:
    * Module sitations should be prefixed with "//" and a space on both sides of it.
    * Module names will be written in plain text.
    * All modules will be referenced with dots rather than slashes.
    * All module "paths" start at "src", and therefore do not require that prefix.
    * Module names should not contain extra decorative symbols like apostrophes.

## Known Object IDs:
    * 28: Some form of "bank". (Snow, likely) // sonicgba.bank
    * 29: Some form of "bank". (Probably different from #28) // sonicgba.bank
