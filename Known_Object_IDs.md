# Description
This file contains all of the known/documented object IDs (Types).

This list is not finished, and may or may not actually reflect the code.
Take this information with a grain of salt.

This list contains ID/type numbers, what we think they are, and optionally, where we learned about them.

The module sitation syntax is as follows:
    * Module names will be written in plain text.
    * All module "paths" start at "src", and therefore do not require that prefix.
    * Module names should not contain extra decorative symbols like apostrophes.
    * All modules will be referenced with dots rather than slashes.

Object IDs are represented with the 'objId' field, presumably located in 'GameObject' or 'GimmickObject'.

## List
    * 28: Some form of "bank". (Snow, likely) // sonicgba.bank
    * 29: Some form of "bank". (Probably different from #28) // sonicgba.bank
